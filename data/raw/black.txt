He was dressed again all in black, a color that should have minimized his size but just amplified how ripped he was beneath the clothing.
He sensed the visions in her head, not surprised to see his own black memories playing on the screens on the back of her eyelids along with a dark nightmare of a man in a corner crying.
It wrenched open, and a man in a black trench coat Damian's size looked her over once.
Shadows chased her up the stairs and flew down the halls, coating the floors and walls in shallow, black fog.
He drew away from her, and she met his black gaze.

"As soon as he's done, we'll start working on you," the Black God promised.
"I've been right here!" she said, shoving at him and his black memories.
The Black God looked from her towards the direction of the voice.
"Two, bring her," the infuriated Black God ordered.
She sobbed, absorbing the black visions spilling through his mind.
Pierre gripped each of their arms and led them toward two black Tahoes.

Deidre continued through the halls lined with torches bearing black flames.
It was hunched over a book large enough to cover half the black stone desk at which it sat.
A small hourglass with black sand was in his palm.

She had two markings on her back: One burgundy, the familiar Immortal mating tattoo, and the new one black, positioned directly beneath the original.

Death was a dark, towering, muscular figure in the living area of her apartment, clothed in black and wearing an expression that mirrored what she felt.

He was like a massive shadow among the sunny forest, dressed all in black and armed as if for battle, even when coming to see her.
A head taller than her, he was lean and calm, his black eyes missing nothing.
The demon's wiry frame was armed, his black eyes steady and quiet power restrained.

The black dress she wore fit her like a second skin, outlining every curve, dip and nook of her body.
After a moment, a form emerged from the black portal.
As she stepped through, so did Darkyn's mate, from a black portal to her left.
Sensing her alarm, Darkyn's mate turned and took the arm of the girl behind her, pushing her towards the black door to Hell.
It was pointless to buy a bikini and wear it only once, so Carmen bought a black push-up bra and some skimpy black briefs trimmed with black ribbon.
While he was in the bathroom she stripped down to the black underwear and gave her hair another brushing.
The off-the-shoulder style with its white lace made the most of her newly acquired tan, and the shiny black belt and full skirt made her waist look small.
I remembered how you acted when you saw me in the black underwear.
Yeah, that was probably said by someone who didn't have a big sow black bear after them.
The man standing in the weedy area of the lot was tall and thick, dressed in a trench coat, black clothing and heavy boots.
The eyes that once turned from black to white to every color in between were now blue-green in color, and her face held a human flush enhanced by his lovemaking.
His eyes were white then black then changed from every color in between, his brown hair of medium length and wavy, ruffled by the sea breeze.
They carried weapons, too, and their eyes were pure black, their teeth pointed like Jared's.
The flutter of a black trench coat blended with the dark sky as Gabriel twisted them in midair, so he'd hit back first, with her protected in his arms.
There were no trench coats outside of the underworld he'd consider wearing, but he pulled on a soft black t-shirt and strapped a few sheaths to his body.
Tall and lean, with eyes as black as Gabriel's, the man who stood too close for her comfort wore normal enough clothing, aside from the knives strapped to his thighs.
His eye was black, one of his cheekbones yellow.
As she watched, the black eye and bruised cheek healed themselves.
Dressed in black, he was an imposing figure, even in the cavernous room.
Dressed all in black with weapons strapped in places identical to where Gabriel wore his, the tall man was lean with cold eyes.
The muscular frame, black gaze, dark clothes all looked the same.
She stood on a covered landing of a fortress made of black stones overlooking a parched desert beneath dual suns too faded to provide anything other than indirect light.
It was dim inside the stronghold, and the first torch they crossed that burned with black flames mesmerized her long enough for her to lose sight of Darkyn around a corner.
He led her past closed doors and through hallways carved out of black stone.
One opened it for him, and she trailed him into a large bedchamber complete with a hearth burning black flames.
It was muted black, made out of material smoother than silk that draped over her arm like a second skin.
She changed out of her familiar clothing into the dress that matched the black world around her.
Deidre opened her eyes and blinked rapidly, realizing the black she tried to clear from her sight was the black ceiling of the operating room.
The walls, however, were as black as the ceiling.
She wore the black dress still.
The only difference was her hair and the eyes that turned from white to black to every color in between.
She sat in a chair by the black hearth.
It gave off heat despite the black flames.
She was beautiful, a woman of sunshine, smiles, and eyes that changed from white to black and every color in between.
Death held out her hand, and an hourglass with black sand appeared in her palm.
She tipped the hourglass, and black sand began to spill.

The black lady's tone left no imagination to what she thought of the latest deadbeat mom in her office.
He was tall and clothed in all black, ominous and large against the slate sky.
The man in black approached.
She stepped back even more and clenched the purse to her body, distracted as a sleek black car pulled up to the curb.
She took one more look at the ominous man in black and the sword at his hip and followed, shaking from more than cold.
Katie instinctively believed her and twisted, staring with Toby at the man in black who watched them drive away.
She felt the cold, black glare and fought the urge to run back inside the clinic.
He was in black, unaffected by the cold or the light settling over him, outlining him like glitter on black construction paper.
Toby had drawn him on black construction paper with silver glitter outlining the shape of a man.
Her mind cleared, and she wiped her eyes at the massive form in black before her.
He was close to seven feet tall, with chiseled features and eyes as black as eternity.
His eyes glowed darker than night, two black holes in his otherwise indistinguishable face.
He was muscular and tall, clothed in dark jeans, a snug grey T-shirt that hugged his biceps and stretched across his chest and back and then sagged at his slender torso and hips, and a round black medallion that fell from his T-shirt as he leaned over her.
He shook the hand of his brother and friend, whose black skin clashed with his.
It was three months' salary, though Hannah had added it to the black AmEx her fianc√© paid in full every month without a second thought.
Andre's apartment was black and fiery.
His eyes were black and empty, his frame small and wiry.

He made his way through the castle with the black stones as he had many times during his long stay.
Sasha was waiting for him in his study, sitting beside a fireplace that burned with black flames.
His gaze took in Sasha before sliding to the black flames.
She followed, startled, only to see a massive black bird the size of a pterodactyl coasting along the tops of the waves.
Katie faced him and saw that he was dressed like Gabriel, all in black.
She sat on the river bank across from a series of wide, large steps leading up a hill to the park where the Arch stood, framed against a black sky.
The only brother not to declare outright war on him, Kiki was a distant second to Andre in his tepid support of their black sheep of a young brother.
He wore his customary all black, his dark eyes hidden behind dark shades.
He wore all black, though he was dressed more simply than she'd seen him, in dark jeans and a black long-sleeved T-shirt and heavy boots.
There were wide eighteenth- century ball gowns, women in little black dresses, one in a fifties poodle skirt, and several in dark dresses with ornate brocade on the bodice, like that of wealthy Middle Age royalty.
His black gaze was still visible in the dark living room.
Another wild adventure by the black sheep of a sister that was dear Hannah's.
Rhyn emerged from the shadows near the window, dressed in black with his hair tied back.
Suddenly, a massive black jaguar leapt past her toward the nearest trail.

It was not all black but had a white patch around one eye.
The room consisted of a massive bed with black bedding and white pillows, a wardrobe and trunks, and yawning windows to the sky that light never touched.
And don't try to tell me that black cat wasn't you!
Far across the sea, he saw the black walls of Hell stretching from water to sky.
He gazed into the black flames of the fire in the hearth.
He trotted down a set of black lacquered stairs, an iPad tucked under one arm.
He didn.t stay to hear the splash this time but walked through the shadow world toward the only portal that glowed black, the portal to Hell.
A massive creature with black fur and fangs paused in front of the open door, sniffing the air.

She relaxed into the comfortable black desk chair in front of her computer, wondering if Romas had told Evelyn of the half a dozen kids he expected.

I see you're not wearing black today.
To them, she was an exotic little doll with her huge, gem-hued eyes, black hair, and toned hour-glass shape.

His black curly hair was cut short, every hair in place, and his angular jaws were freshly shaven.
Those pans are all black on the bottom and...
And then everything went black again.
The narrow black highway ribboned smoothly down hill under a canopy of trees.
Her gaze dropped to the driver's seat, where a small black military radio sat where none had been when she left the car.
The muscular woman, with short blond hair and clad in black tactical gear, stood in a stark white hallway.
George, I have a small black box about the size of your hand with nothing but a keypad in it.
He opened it and looked at the small black keypad a quarter the size of his palm.
She'd removed her personal identifiers, hacked into the government's tracking mainframe to deactivate the implant in her brain, and changed into the black tactical uniform Elise brought her over her civilian grays.
"You don't look like a spec ops soldier," he said, referring to the black uniform Elise insisted she wear.
He took each side of her collar and pulled, the effortless movement ripping the black uniform down the middle.
The man before her snatched one arm and flipped out a knife, cutting through her black clothing and tossing it aside.
Her black uniform was clean and waiting for her.
Soon after, the men in black mowed down two of Dan's men, and the three of them were left to fend for themselves.
They were going into the black water, hundreds of feet beneath them.
The occupant of the large chair in the corner of the living room launched towards her in a flurry of brown and black fur.
Tim stood in his black fed uniform, comfortable with the soldiers eyeing him.
Several soldiers‚Äîtwo in grays and three in black uniforms‚Äîapproached the bonfire, speaking with the men gathered in a group on one side.
Two soldiers‚Äîone in black and one in gray‚Äîapproached.
"Welcome," the man in black said at last.
He was more intrigued by the sight of soldiers in PMF grays as well as those in the regular military's black uniforms.
More soldiers in gray and black made their way down the bonfires, pausing to talk to Mike.
Mike stopped finally in a chamber where two soldiers‚Äîone in black and one in gray‚Äîwere dusting themselves off.
"At first, I think it was knowing he was a black sheep like me.¬† My sister always treated me like I was a blight on the family name.¬† She tried to help me in her own way, I guess, which was better than what Rhyn's brothers did to him.¬† I wanted to believe he could make it in the Immortal world, because if he could, I could, too," she started.
An hour glass with streaming black sand appeared in his palm.
Rhyn crept carefully through the demon scouts positioned throughout the forest surrounding the castle.¬† The demons wore the Dark One's uniform of all black with waterproof cloaks and hoods.¬† The demon side of him rendered his presence similar enough to a full-demon's that the others wouldn't be alarmed.¬† He sized up each demon he passed, until he found one who appeared to be his size.¬† The creature didn't hear his soft step, and the snapping of the demon's neck was the only other sound in the falling rain.
The water looked ‚Ä¶ black in the moonlight.¬† She took a step back and looked up towards the moons.¬† As Gabriel indicated, one moon was lower than the other.
The sounds of fighting grew faint and then disappeared.¬† The stream wound through the jungle until it reached a small waterfall that fed into a massive lake whose black surface reflected the stars and moon.¬† Katie slid down the hill beside the waterfall to the lake's edge, uncertain what to do.¬† Gabriel hadn't mentioned the stream ending or the lake.
Rhyn opened a portal and walked through the cool shadow place.¬† The shadow world felt ‚Ä¶ strange this time.¬† He looked around, unsettled by the sensation that someone else was there.¬† The black portal to Hell throbbed then dimmed, as if someone and come through.
Toby huddled against the black stone wall of his cell in Hell.
Rhyn awoke from the island dreamscape in the shadow world.¬† He rose, uncertain what happened but recalling his urgency.¬† He crossed through the glowing black portal into the one place he'd hoped never to see again: Hell.¬† Unwilling to get stuck in the cell where he'd spent many lifetimes, he chose to open the portal into the office of the Council's betrayer, Sasha. ¬†The office was as he remembered it, down to the black flames in the hearth.
Yes. And the man in black who used to visit you.
"I'm not sure.¬† I was at home when someone broke in.¬† I heard someone screaming then something hot went straight through me.¬† Everything went black, and I woke up here," the woman explained.
More thunder boomed.¬† Katie wondered what other kinds of storms the underworld might have.¬† Would it rain something other than black water?¬† With her luck, it'd rain bugs, like the beetle nest she skirted.
Kris looked up in time to see Kiki crash through the canopy and plummet towards the ground.¬† Kris gasped and sprung forward.¬† A streak of black crossed his vision as a flying demon snatched Kiki out of the air.
Gabe and a few other assassins in black fought off hordes of demons.¬† Surprised, Rhyn launched into the melee with his dagger.¬† He slashed through several demons before the creatures realized he was there.¬† Wanting to keep them off balance, he morphed into his demon form and shredded the creatures with talons and fangs as deadly as theirs.
The black sand had run out.¬† He'd missed his window.¬† Rather, he missed this window.¬† He looked over at the demon standing before him.¬† At least one of his super-demons had survived.¬† This one still wore half a face, that of Death's favorite assassin, Gabriel.
Gabe took the necklace, looking at the two emeralds on the black leather-like cord.¬† He'd missed his necklace after eons wearing it.¬† He'd missed his mother and baby brother. ¬†He squeezed them in his hand in the only hug he could give his dead family.
Gabe stepped closer to the Lake. ¬†Even through the black water, he could see the green souls at the bottom.
I was wearing jeans and a black shirt.
His hair was a tad past barbering time and he wore polished black shoes and black socks, inconsistent with the rest of his attire.
"You be careful now," Leo called after him, "it's pitch black over there on the beach."
When he could finally focus through the black of the night, he plodded forward, feet wallowing in the soft sand like a boat in a heavy sea.
He was slowly picking pieces of Styrofoam flotsam from his early morning cup of black coffee.
Both drank their coffee black and although both took a doughnut, Mrs. Byrne simply picked at hers, lifting the tiniest of crumbs with dampened fingertips.
He has a black and white sense of right and wrong.
His high-water trousers exposed black silk socks with little ladders up the sides, held in place with garters, something Dean hadn't seen in decades.
"Put on your glasses, you'll go blind doing that," Dean said, handing Fred his beer and reclaiming his rocker from Mrs. Lincoln, the large black cat that had adopted the pair the prior February.
Mrs. Byrne was dressed in a black jersey dress with a single strand of pearls around her neck.
She jumped off in her graceful way, a bal¬≠lerina in a black fur coat.
A very tall, per¬≠fectly proportioned black man, looking like the front page of a fashion magazine, smiled and held out his hand.
Everything about him was perfect, from the glass polish of his black shoes to the knife-like crease in his thousand-dollar suit.
It's dark out, as black as Winston here, and we drop 'em and scoot.
Blond hair or maybe light brown‚Äînot black.
A stack of books rested in front of her and she sipped a cup of black coffee.
Cora had spotted a car, a black Buick this time, but had not written down the license plate num¬≠ber.
Two neighbors reported seeing a black car near the house.
I should be wearing black instead of enjoying myself, even if it's only once in awhile.
The guy had black hair and a mustache.
He might have a mustache, black hair or a shaved head for all we know, and two and a half mil¬≠lion could buy a face-job making him look like Robert Redford.
He didn't know a name or a number but the fellow had black hair.
He was still above the timberline, devoid of any trees that would impair visibility so it was clear enough to follow the road with its many switchbacks and curves traversing the mountain below him, a black line clinging to the side of the cliff like a pen¬≠cil drawing.
He ran a hand through short curly black hair that didn't need straightening.
It had finally been in the black and she was actually making a profit.
Those delicious milk chocolate eyes and long black lashes were hypnotic.
The pupils in his eyes were dilated so large that his eyes looked black in a face that had gone strangely pale.
The black frame with its hunter green trim rested on blocks right now.
Black spots clouded her vision as she grabbed the receiver, and then she fell.
He actually made the plunge into that bottomless black pool sound almost enticing.
The Black God wants to be the only god the humans know.
And you all in black.
His eyes and hair were black, his features noble.
Claire stared after him then looked back at the stranger in black.
"I'm Czerno, the Black God, your new master and mate," he said.
Immobilized, fear rose within her as she watched the Black God lift Darian's bloody form from the ground.
The human world will fall to the Black God if you aren't there to protect it.
Jenn glimpsed the black curls of her daughter's head as her mother tried to push her away.
Fire still raged at one end of the orchard, filling the air above the trees with black smoke.
Gather your Guardians and battle the Black God, the Watcher said.
Present Day Fortress of the Black God
The Black God was slipping out of her influence.
Jonny, the Black God, broke her Zen-like moment.
The Black God glowed like a storm cloud.
She had just under fourteen days left with the Black God until his bargain with her boss was up, and she could go home.
With four days at most remaining in her ability to control the Black God, she suspected she'd be dead in five.
Darian had followed her around like a lost puppy before she was assigned to the Black God.
She couldn't help feeling relieved the Black God didn't want her going with him this time.
Jenn drew a knife and obeyed, guessing whatever awaited her couldn't be much worse than the Black God or Original Vamp.
Damian's nature was not like Darian's and their father's, but he'd shouldered the responsibility to protect humanity and battle the Black God without question.
One of their brothers, Jule, had told them quietly where Jenn was after a trip to visit one of the vamps holed up with the Black God.
He shouldn't draw attention using magic this close to the Black God's hideout.
They were passive aggressive with her, hazing her when the Black God and Xander weren't around.
They obeyed faster than they ever would a command from the Black God, who still struggled to control his vamps.
She'd seen him trying to train the Black God a couple of times but never in the ring with any of the vamps.
The Black God's bedroom door was closed for the first time in a week.
Judging by the position of his computer, he'd been on it last night, and the black notebook where he wrote notes to himself about his duties was missing.
Damian had assigned her here to help Jonny root out the vamps who were working with Others in the Black God's ranks.
More importantly, she had to find out what Jonny's next step was, once the month-long truce between White and Black Gods was up.
The dead woman's pale skin and hair starkly contrasted with Jonny's black silk sheets and duvet.
What dismay she felt at Jonny's first killing a week ago had slid into understanding that the Black God was merely becoming what he was.
Darian found a summer cabin beside a lake in a small logging town near the Black God's hideout.
She was constantly assessing him and had been since she discovered him as a prisoner of the Black God.
The little black one with blue eyes.
He'd had them frequently when Sofi freed him from the Black God.
For months, he'd black out several times a day and wake up somewhere else, usually with the room around him in shambles.
Darian exited and dressed in all black, arming himself with knives.
They weren't far from the Black God's mountain fortress.
Rather than risk Traveling to the center of the phenomenon, Jenn ran down the driveway the vamps had cleared of snow to the narrow country road leading up the mountain to the Black God's hideout.
She jumped, surprised to find the Black God a couple of feet behind her, staring at the scene.
The Black God snatched her ankle, dragging her back.
The Black God's power swelled, stifling the air around them.
She recognized him as Charles, the vamp Damian had gotten in exchange for sending her to the Black God.
"The Others are right here on my doorstep, Jenn, and I can't find them!" the Black God said in frustration.
You're the Black God.
Why were the Others lurking in the forest outside the Black God's fortress, if not to kill them all?
If the Black God hadn't been there, we wouldn't have been able to save you.
Jenn sheathed her weapons and started down the peak above the Black God's mountain fortress.
He'd changed again over the course of the two weeks she'd been assigned to the Black God.
Darian asked, taking in the vamps outside the doorway of the Black God's fortress.
The White God hadn't said a word, until requesting a hostage of his own in exchange for sending his brother to live with the Black God.
I've watched Jonny turn into the Black God.
They walked past Darian, with the Black God hesitating before continuing on.
After her two weeks in the Black God's chaotic camp, she'd almost forgotten what it was like to be in an organization that took care of its own.
With a sinking stomach, Jenn admitted she had less than a day of influence left on the Black God.
The Black God hesitated one more time before striding forward.
The Black God awaited him.
A different instinct went off in Darian's mind, one that recognized the look on the Black God's face as being another sign Jenn was in more trouble than expected.
The Black God's face flashed bright red.
I'm the Black God.
The Black God turned and walked away.
As the White and Black Gods of this earth, you are bound by the requirement to turn the violator over to us.
Darian asked, stepping into the center of the room beside the White and Black Gods.
A look at Jonny sent the Black God back quickly as well.
She opened her eyes and found herself in the locker room at the Black God's lair.
The Black God bristled with contained power.
But I also know he made a mistake long before he became the Black God.
The fury he'd felt since awakening from the dark place the Black God kept him started to fade.
The black memories that made him wake up screaming at night, the fear he could still taste in moments of despair, were softened by the sense of stillness that settled into him.
Since he was freed from his imprisonment to the Black God?
He'd learned a few things about killing from the previous Black God, lessons that would now serve him well.
"I can," Darian said, thinking of the Black God and the Others.
There's no telling with a Black God.
A Black God does not know restraint.
"I know you're not paying room and board, but you're running up the bill," the Black God said from inside the fortress.
The Black God looked around him, disoriented, as if he'd been dropped into the foyer and not Traveled there himself.
"I need more heads for my collection," the Black God said with vehemence.
"No, Jenn," the Black God said with a shake of his head.
